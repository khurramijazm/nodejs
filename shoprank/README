Shoprank is actually a website which will have experience of 
customers recorded against differnt shops and their ranking. This will serve as
a guide map for new commers to the town to be aware of certain shops where you 
might expect to get ripped off. 

The idea came to my mind when my friend shared his story with me about his laptop. Where 
his one year old son pissed on the laptop. He took the laptop the computer market where
the guy started learning fixing problems using his laptop and din't fixed any thing for him . Well 
i tought to publish this type of behaviour on the internet so that other might find it use full 
who to visit when they are in similar  situtation. 

There is lot more on that comming soon.
