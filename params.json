There are very use full tutorials every about node, but here you will see code samples. Feel free to copy paste and or push new additions. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ https://github.com/khurramijazm/nodejs.git\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Backbone.js And Underscore.js\r\nThe node tutorial would be incomplete without backbone.js. Backbone has hard dependency upon underscore.js. I believe it is an Art to structure your code and Backbone is the tool. More will \r\nbe added here soon. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@khurramijazm . \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to send me an email at khurramijazm@gmail.com.
